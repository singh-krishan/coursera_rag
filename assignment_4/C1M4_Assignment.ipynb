    "# Programming Assignment: Developing a RAG-based Chatbot\n",
    "---\n",
    "Welcome to your fourth assignment in the RAG course! Having acquired foundational techniques, you are now ready to embark on building a more sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. In this assignment, you will undertake the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM routing**: Develop functions to help categorize and identify the type of each query, creating a router that, depending on the query nature, different treatments are performed.\n",
    "- **Conditional parameter setting**: Create methods to determine if a user’s query is creative or technical. This allows the LLM to adjust its settings to give the best answer.\n",
    "- **Producing JSON Responses**: Program the LLMs to generate valid JSON responses with product information, making sure the output is organized for more processing if needed.\n",
    "- **Adding Contextual Information**: Include relevant data in queries before they are handled by the LLM.\n",
    "- **Chatbot Development**: Create a chatbot that can interact with users in a natural and efficient way, answering their questions clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply the skills you've learned to integrate RAG capabilities into a RAG system that will support a ChatBot."
